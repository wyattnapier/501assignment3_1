# Assignment 3-1: Weighted Split Layout
This application takes the screen and splits a row into a 25% width section and a 75% width section. 
Within that larger section, there is a column that is split into vertically stacked sections of proportional size 2:3:5. 
Then, each section is color-coded and labeled by proportion. Below is a screenshot of the app.
